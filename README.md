# rkhunter-installer

rkhunter is a Unix-based tool that scans for rootkits, backdoors and possible local exploits. It does this by comparing SHA-1 hashes of important files with known good ones in online databases, searching for default directories, wrong permissions, hidden files, suspicious strings in kernel modules and special tests for Linux and FreeBSD.
